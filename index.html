                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This Rick and Morty themed challenge requires you to exploit a webserver to find 3 ingredients that will help Rick make his potion to transform himself back into a human from a pickle.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Link to the challenge : <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick">https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick</a></p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The first flag</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">First, let's start by deploying the virtual machine to be attacked. For this challenge, the IP address that was provided to me for the virtual machine is : 10.10.120.45</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once the IP address is obtained, we can then type the server's IP address in the search bar of a web browser to make a GET request and get a web page in return. The web page that will be returned to us in response by the web server is the following :
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image1.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One of the first reflexes we should have is to inspect the source code of the web page to find a clue. In fact, we can find the following comment that was accidentally left there: "Note to self, remember username ! Username: R1ckRul3s".
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image2.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Then, we have to find other clues. Since there is no hyperlink or button on the web page that allow us to go to another page, we have to find more resources on the web server, because otherwise we are limited in clues.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Lucky for us, there is an excellent tool called Gobuster that can help us identify directories and files on the web server. In order to fulfill our needs with this tool, we need to provide the IP address of the web server and a .txt file containing a list of words. The list of words that we will use is the following one:
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt">https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt</a>
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Let's open the terminal. To use Gobuster to identify directories and files on the web server, we need to type a command in the following form :</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">gobuster dir -u MACHINE_IP -w WORD_LIST
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In our case, MACHINE_IP will be the IP address of the web server (10.10.120.45 in my case) and WORD_LIST will be our downloaded common.txt file.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image3.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image4.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once Gobuster has finished applying its magic, we can notice a robots.txt file that piques our interest. We retrieve this resource on the web server and suddenly we find an interesting string.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image5.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Cool! Maybe this string is a password. After all, we had previously found a username at the very beginning of the challenge. Why not try to connect via SSH? Let's start by identifying the open ports on the web server with the Nmap port scanner.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image6.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image7.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                We can see that port 22 is open and accepting connections via SSH. That's great! We can try to connect to the web server via SSH with the username found at the very beginning of the challenge (R1ckRul3s) and with the string found in the robots.txt file (Wubbalubbadubdub) as the password. However we will encounter a problem.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image8.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Unfortunately, we were denied permission to connect. However, we don't give up. If you recall, we are attacking a web server and among the ports listed by Nmap during the port scan, port 80 was open and accepting connections. Why not use a tool like Nikto to scan for vulnerabilities on the web server? We can use the following command :
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                nikto -h http://MACHINE_IP -o scan.txt
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/image9.PNG" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Once the command is executed and the scan is finished, we can go and see the result in scan.txt. There we will find this:
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

                                Great! It seems that our scan has discovered a /login.php page on the web server. Let's access this page.

                                On this web page, we can notice an input field that seems to take in entry commands that can be executed on the web server. Why not take the opportunity to list files and directories that are on the web server? Let's use the following command to achieve this:
                            </p>
